            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="images/prenup_pics/image11.jpeg" alt="Prenup Photo" class="story-prenup-img">
            <p>He was a lost, wandering young man — searching for direction, for meaning, for a place where his heart could finally rest.
She was a girl doing her best to keep everything together, trying to make sense of life while quietly carrying more than anyone ever knew.</p>

            <p>And then, in the most unexpected moment, their worlds met.</p>

            <p>He found her at her lowest when life felt heavier than usual. Instead of walking away, he stayed. Piece by piece, he helped pick up what was broken, not to fix her, but to show her she never had to carry anything alone again.
And in loving him, she helped him find the clarity, strength, and purpose he had long been searching for.</p>

            <p>What started as two weary souls crossing paths soon blossomed into something beautiful. They became college sweethearts — nursing students who studied side by side, survived exams together, and held on to the same dream: to become better people each day, instruments of healing, angels with stethoscopes.</p>

            <p>They grew as individuals, but even more as partners. Through quiet nights, long shifts, failures, victories, and whispered prayers, they learned what real companionship felt like — steady, patient, and full of grace.</p>

            <p>Now, after years of dreaming and striving hand in hand, they are tying the knot.
Stepping into forever, still side by side, still choosing each other.
Still anchored in faith, still in pursuit of God's purpose for their lives — not as two separate journeys, but finally as one.</p>

            <p>This is their story — unexpected, imperfect, redeemed, and beautifully theirs.
And it's only the beginning. ❤</p>
